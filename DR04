***MISSION DEBRIEF***
Operator: LCpl Bonestroo
Operation: DR04
MC: MC2
Analyst: Analyst1
Description: The goal of the operation was to enumerate Krasnovian 1st Artillery BDE network further, and maneuver through network and survey end user hosts (T4-T7). The operation was overall a success.  The operator redirected from ops station to EXT_RTR to SERVER0 to INT_RTR2 to ADMIN2 to TARGETA to TARGETB, then backed out to ADMIN2 and redirected to TARGETC. T1 had a security product and remote logging. T2 had abnormal logging and a privileged user; operator redirected to T3 using netsh. T3 had a security product. T4 had a security product and abnormal logging; operator conducted a device survey. T5 had abnormal logging and remote logging; operator conducted a device survey, collected all .txt files, and used iptables to redirect to T6. T6 appeared to be a clean box; operator conducted a device survey and collected all images from root's home directory. Operator then exit vetted and disconnected from T6 and T5, removed the iptables rule, and used Evil WinRM to connect to T7.  T7 had a security product; operator conducted a device survey.  Operator screwed up and forgot to request to remove netsh rule from T2, along with reporting that root had logged in on T1.
