Reporting
=================================================================================================================
Report when you have as much as you can about what you are reporting
MC needs to be informed of all things that impact the risk of the op
YOU are expected to be the technical expert - MC assumes the risk but does not absolve you of any issues that arise associated with that risk
When reporting items, it is imperative to have as much information about the non-standard item as you can gather. This is a benefit to yourself and the Mission Commander to ensure that you understand what the item is and what itâ€™s capable of, and ensure that you can verbalize that to the MC
any action that is not listed on the Mission Plan, you must get authorization from the Mission Commander

Reports to MC (Risk=MC):
  Verify all IP addresses on mission plan before beginning operation
  All connections to each target
  All disconnections from each target
  Collecting a 10 MB file or larger
  Logged on Privileged Users
  Unknown processes/files/jobs*
  Malware or Security Product
  Removing anything from target
  Placing any file on target
  Changing anything on a target
  Adding an IP to the mission plan
  Encountering an unexpected OS  (Unexpected OS not version)
  Any form of abnormal/remote logging*
  Verification of T10 effect immediately before emplacing it
  Taking any action not identified in the mission plan
  Provide details for DEBRIEF after the mission
  Anything that might change the risk on target

Reports to Non-Standard Database (NSDB):
  Any risk reported to the MC (malware, logging, etc) should have an NSDB entry
  Unlike other reports, the NSDB entry is not written for the present, but the future
  More detailed than the MC report
  Documents all known risks in a project
  Allows analysts to better plan operations
  Allows for a more informed operation approval process
  Allows for better OPSEC for fellow operators
  Allows operator to express opinions and make risk recommendations to leadership based on what was observed

Malware Reportable Items:
Malware is defined as any software that is installed on a computer UNKNOWN to the system administrator and WEAKENS the overall security posture of the system
  Process name/options, PID, Parent ID, user, and hash
  File type of malware binary and supporting files
  Associated logs generated by malware
  Location and lines of any persistence mechanisms
  Full path of malware files or support files
  Network connections opened/established by malware
  Identifiable text
  Modules loaded by malware
  Brief description of malware purpose/actions and capabilities
  Recommendation - Do we need to be concerned or adjust our plans?

Abnormal Logging Reportable Items:
Abnormal logging is defined as any logging that occurs outside of the operating system's default values and includes remote logging, network logging, process logging, et cetera
  Provide process name/options, PID, Parent ID, user
  Provide location of configuration file and it's abnormal or irregular contents
  Provide hostname or IP of where logs are being sent
  Provide any network connections opened/established by abnormal logging
  Provide brief description of the abnormal, irregular or remote logging
  Recommendation - Do we need to be concerned or adjust our plans?

Security Products Reportable Items:
Security products are well-defined software programs that are either default to the operating system or are installed by the computer owner for the strict purpose of finding/blocking/removing malicious (as seen by the computer administrator) software
  Name and version of the product
  Primary registry key
  Installation folder
  Directory location of associated logs
  Timestamp of all associated log files
  Cloud based?; yes or no
  Can we read the logs?; yes or no
    -If Yes, put the most recent 5 lines of logs in your NSDB File
    -If No, why?
  Recommendation - Do we need to be concerned or adjust our plans?

Privileged User Reportable Items:
A privileged user is a user with the access and ability to detect on net activities and take action to hinder, stop, or prevent it
  Target - Where did you see this user?
  User - What is their username?
  Access time - How long have they been on?
  Access method - Did they access locally? Remotely?
  Provide all relevant details
  Privileges - What are they capable of doing?
  Activity - What are they currently doing?
  Recommendation - Do we need to be concerned? Do we need to adjust our plans?

DEBRIEF (Mission Report) - A mission summary submitted to the MC for awareness purposes
DEBRIEF Template:
Operator: <your name>
Operation: <name of operation>
MC: <name of MC>
Analyst: <name of analyst>
Description: <two-three sentence overall description of operation followed by a minimum of one sentence per target.>

Reports to Analyst:
Your analyst is the Subject Matter expert on all things minus the technical information for the operation
They are also the network SME. They know the proper routes and hops to take to get to the endpoints
Your analyst will not be able to help you with any technical issues that arise; This includes syntax
They will be able to assist you with items from the mission plan that are not explicitly written, such as missing creds and possibly missing IPs and ports
Remember: they are the ones that write the Mission Plans. Any questions or concerns that you have about the mission and/or the mission plan should be addressed with them
  Target's network information (IP and MAC addresses) upon connection
  Completion of mission plan tasks
