***MISSION DEBRIEF***
Operator: LCpl Bonestroo
Operation: AB01
MC: MC1
Analyst: Analyst2
Description: The goal of the operation was to configure koadic stagers on Listening Post (LP) to accept callbacks that follow the scheme of maneuver. Perform SSH masquerade to T1 and establish tunnels to catch callbacks from T2-T5. Conduct device surveys on T2-T5. Operation was overall successful with a few hiccups, such as all terminals crashing. Operator redirected to the LP to KOA_EXT_RTR and from the EXT_RTR redirected using Koadic to T2, T3, T4, and T5. LP had a privileged user. T1 had a security product, privileged user, and remote logging; operator set up remote tunnel to catch callback from T2. T2 had a privilege user; operator conducted a device survey, exit vetted and disconnected. T3 had a privileged user; operator conducted a device survey, exit vetted and disconnected. T4 had a privileged user; operator conducted a device survey, exit vetted and disconnected. T5 had a privileged user; operator conducted a device survey, exit vetted and disconnected. Operator then exited vetted T1 and the LP and disconnected from the network.


Result: Fail
Missed nonstandard:
-Malware
Tarball: contained .swp files

Recommendation - SELinux is enabled and in enforcing mode.  It will log our actions, but it does not prevent us from continuing, and we were not really concerned with logs in the first place. Recommend CM.

Abnormal Logging
