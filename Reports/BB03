***MISSION DEBRIEF***
Operator: LCpl Bonestroo
Operation: BB03
MC: MC2
Analyst: Analyst2
Description: The goal of the operation was to perform survey of identified user devices within Krasnovian 3rd Armour BDE internal network (192.186.169.0/24). Once successfully accessed, add a user to the root group on T8 (192.186.169.142 // hostname â€œDESKTOP-USER24") for sustained access assurance. The operation was overall successful. Operator redirected from EXT_RTR to STORAGE2 to Vyos2 to ADMIN2 where he then pivoted to DESKTOP-USER21 before backing out to T4 and redirecting to T6 backed out to T4 and redirected to T7 backed out to T4. Operator redirected from T4 to DESKTOP-USER24 where operator conducted a T10 effect.  T1 was a clean box. T2 had a privileged user. T3 appeared to be a clean box. T4 also appeared to be a clean box aside from the previously reported and known pacct. T5 had a privileged user and abnormal logging; EA told operator not to conduct the device survey. T6 had a privileged user and two types of malware; operator conducted a device survey. T7 had a privileged user, a security product suite, and an empty security product; operator conducted a device survey. T8 had a security product and remote logging; operator conducted a device survey. After confirming the hostname of T8, operator executed T10 effect in the form of adding a new user to the box. Operator exit vetted and disconnected from the network.


Result: FAIL

Missed Security Product
