***MISSION DEBRIEF***
Operator: LCpl Bonestroo
Operation: BB04
MC: MC1
Analyst: Analyst2
Description: The goal of this op was to confirm health and status of all previously accessed targets. Intelligence reports suggest T9 (129.168.169.186) is a new, unidentified admin workstation and T10 (10.20.169.121) is the network web server. Once connected and confirmed on the correct target web server, deliver the approved cyber effect to deny port 1480 traffic. The operation was overall successful.  Operator redirected from EXT_RTR to STORAGE1, CHATSVR, and STORAGE2; operator was unable to access FILESVR due to it being on hold. Operator then redirected from STORAGE2 to Vyos2 to ADMIN2 to DESKTOP-USER21; operator was unable to add iptable rules to DESKTOP-USER21 which prevented access to T9. Operator then exited back to EXT_RTR and redirected to WEBSERVER.  T1 was a clean box. T2 was also a clean box. T3 had a privileged user and abnormal logging. T4 was on hold. T5 had a privileged user. T6 had a privileged user. T7 didn't have anything that hadn't already been reported. T8 had two privileged users; operator had to burn off the box, which meant that the iptables rule was not added and operator could not access T9. Operator then exit vetted and disconnected back to T1 where he redirected to T10. T10 had a security product and remote logging; operator conducted a device survey and verified the device with the EA. Operator then conducted T10 effects, verified effects were effective, and removed effects. Operator then exit vetted and disconnected from the network.
