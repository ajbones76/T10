Recommendation - SELinux is enabled and in enforcing mode.  It will log our actions, but it does not prevent us from continuing, and we are not doing any actions that it would catch on this box. Recommend CM.

Abnormal Logging
  Provide process name/options, PID, Parent ID, user
  Name: rsyslog PID: 5226 PPID: 1 User: root
  Provide location of configuration file and it's abnormal or irregular contents - /etc/rsyslog.conf
  Provide hostname or IP of where logs are being sent - 10.49.1.4
  Provide any network connections opened/established by abnormal logging - tcp SYN-SENT 10.145.117.86:42202     10.49.1.4:514  
  Provide brief description of the abnormal, irregular or remote logging - Rsyslog is enabled with remote logging. It is sending all logs to the 10.49.1.4 using port 514
  Documentation - https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/index.html
  Recommendation - CM; we have already been caught, and we were not really concerned with the logs anyway other than the secure and messages logs, which we are clearing. 

Privileged Users
  Target - Where did you see this user? - T1: 10.50.24.145
  User - What is their username? - root
  Access time - How long have they been on? - 2024-05-08 14:33
  Access method - Did they access locally? Remotely? - locally
    Provide all relevant details - tty
  Privileges - What are they capable of doing? - "root" user account on Linux has full administrative privileges over the entire system
  Activity - What are they currently doing? - root has been idle for 22:45m with a bash shell open; root's bash history has: cat /dev/null > /var/log/btmp ; lastb ; exit
 Recommendation - CM cautiously; root has been idle for almost an entire day, still be mindful if they become active again, since they could boot us out.
