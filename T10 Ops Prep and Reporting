ENVIRONMENT PREP
Before the Operation:
Below are the requirements of the Operator before conducting an operation. Failure to do so may result in immediate failure.

    Review mission plan
    Power on OpStation
    Create STUDENT DIRECTORY: /<student#>_<dd-mm-yy>_<op#>
    cd into STUDENT DIRECTORY
    Create an opnotes file with: vim notes_<dd-mm-yy>
    Create a NSDB file with: vim NSDB_<dd-mm-yy>
    Script all target and scanning terminal windows with: script -af termscreen.$$
       Do NOT script your 'notes' or 'NSDB' terminal windows.
    Verify IPs with MC prior to mission start

Reports:
Mandatory Reporting Instructions
Students must ensure communication with their Operational Team. Any of the below situations must be reported to the proper Team member. Any instruction marked with an "AI" will require the operator to Await Instructions, after reporting, before performing mission objectives (collection, deliver effects, etc) OR moving to the next identified target. Students will communicate with MC/Analyst on the identified medium. Personnel assigned to these roles will not provide answers to critical tasks, command line syntax, or assistance with technical issues.\

    Providing details for DEBRIEF after operation
        DEBRIEF Template and example is provided at the bottom of this document
        MUST include 1 sentence per target, as well as logged in privileged user information

During every operation, operators will be required to vet every device they connect to and conduct a minimal OPSEC review before disconnecting from a device. Not running one of the commands (or their equivalent), detailed below, will result in a penalty. Students will not utilize scripts to automatically run all of these commands (or redirect a script through their secure tunnel). Command options can be added to, but not subtracted from each command. Use of unauthorized scripts is prohibited and will result in automatic failure of the operation. For all commands that specify OR, attempt the initial command first.

Notes:
Mandatory Note Taking
Students are required to keep a log of actions taken inside of the opnotes file. These notes are required to include at a minimum:

Op Notes:
    Mission start time
    Mission end time
    Time of each connection and disconnection to each target
    Start and end timestamps of "Upon Connection" and "Before Disconnect" vetting command sections
