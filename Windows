Windows Situational Awareness
=========================================================================================

Main concerns are:
  Logged in Privileged Users
  Malware
  Logging (kind of)
  Security Products
  System resource usage

*DO NOT RUN DATE OR TIME BY ITSELF*

systeminfo
  Device name
  OS version
  CPU and architecture
  System uptime
  Installed RAM and usage
  NIC information

wmic cpu get loadpercentage        #checks the load on the cpu/processor
If see both Program Files and Program Files (x86) it usually means it's a 64-bit
WORKGROUP means box is not actually in a domain

Netstat [options]
/a - Displays all active TCP connections and the TCP and UDP ports on which the computer is listening
/b - Displays the executable involved in creating each connection or listening port. (requires elevated permissions)
/n - Displays active TCP connections, however, addresses and port numbers are expressed numerically and no attempt is made to determine names.
/o - Displays active TCP connections and includes the process ID (PID) for each connection.

WMIC
sc query winmgmt
wmic process get processid, parentprocessid, execuatablepath

Powershell
Be aware of logs generated
  By default it logs in various Windows Event Logs
  Can manipulate stricter logging through GPO settings (Module logging, Script block logging, Transcription)
  Can check these settings with GPResult or looking in the registry

Open Source Research

You may need to build alternate pastables for odd OSs once you’ve identified them in the network
Do not need to report Windows Event Logging for abnormal logging    -    Just need to tell MC what logs you have been logged in

query user : designed for remote environments, this will ONLY display RDP/local logins
netstat /anob : are there any connections associated with their session?
tasklist /V : what is the privileged user running
wmic : lots of uses, but you need specific flags to get the data you want

net localgroup <group>
net user <username>

certutil -hashfile <FilePath> MD5

Security Products
=========================================================================================

Well defined or known; Finds, blocks, and/or removes “malicious” programs
Can Google it and the results are anything similar to “detecting trojans, viruses, malware & other malicious threats”

Spotting Security Products:
  The Tasklist
  Scheduled jobs
  Program Files directory
  The Registry

Microsoft Products:
  Windows Defender
    Windows 8+ default
    Currently supported
    Malware scanning
    Sandboxing
    Heuristics detection (questionably)
  Microsoft Security Essentials
    Windows XP - 7 support
    End of Service, receives signature updates until 2023
  Live OneCare
    Windows Xp - Vista support
    No longer supported
DO NOT NEED TO REPORT WINDOWS DEFENDER

To make a decision on risk, the following information, at a minimum, should to be found:
  Product name and version (usually in the registry)
    Database version
    Software version
  Installation location/executable
  Additional detection modules
  Cloud based detection?
    99% yes


Windows Logging
=========================================================================================

Event Logs - Windows Logs:
Application log
  Application log contains events logged by applications or programs
*Security log*
  Security log contains events such as valid and invalid logon attempts, events related to resource use, such as creating, opening, or deleting files or other objects
Setup log
  Setup log contains events related to application setup
System log
  System log contains events logged by Windows system components; where log is created when a log is cleared

Event Logs - Each event in a log entry contains the following information:
  Log Name: Log the event is stored in
  Source: Audit policy that generated log
  Date: The date/time the event occurred.
  Event ID: A Windows identification number that specifies the event type.
  Task: Windows function identified
  Level/Opcode: The type of event
  Keyword: Audit policy setting for logs
  User: The user name of the user who was logged on when the event occurred.
  Computer: The name of the computer
  Description: Details on users, processes that generated log, data provided by process or software

CLI:
  auditpol
    Run to view what actions Windows is configured to log
    auditpol /get /category:*
  wevtutil  -  how to read the log entries
    wevtutil qe security /c:25 /rd:false /f:text
  Powershell
    Get-EventLog system -newest 3 | Format-List
  WMIC
    Sure you can use it, but these are easier
Just need the Windows Event Log that you are in; most likely Security

wevtutil gli <logname>    -    size of log and number of events
wevtutil cl <logname> /bu:<LocationToBackupPath>    -    backup and clear log

Powershell:
Get-WinEvent -ListLog *    -    list all logs with entry count
Get-EventLog *             -    list main logs with entry count

Usually, application logs will be found in Programfiles or ProgramData
