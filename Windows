Windows Situational Awareness
=========================================================================================

Main concerns are:
  Logged in Privileged Users
  Malware
  Logging (kind of)
  Security Products
  System resource usage

*DO NOT RUN DATE OR TIME BY ITSELF*

systeminfo
  Device name
  OS version
  CPU and architecture
  System uptime
  Installed RAM and usage
  NIC information

wmic cpu get loadpercentage        #checks the load on the cpu/processor
If see both Program Files and Program Files (x86) it usually means it's a 64-bit
WORKGROUP means box is not actually in a domain

Netstat [options]
/a - Displays all active TCP connections and the TCP and UDP ports on which the computer is listening
/b - Displays the executable involved in creating each connection or listening port. (requires elevated permissions)
/n - Displays active TCP connections, however, addresses and port numbers are expressed numerically and no attempt is made to determine names.
/o - Displays active TCP connections and includes the process ID (PID) for each connection.

Be aware of logs generated
  By default it logs in various Windows Event Logs
  Can manipulate stricter logging through GPO settings (Module logging, Script block logging, Transcription)
  Can check these settings with GPResult or looking in the registry

You may need to build alternate pastables for odd OSs once you’ve identified them in the network
Do not need to report Windows Event Logging for abnormal logging    -    Just need to tell MC what logs you have been logged in
